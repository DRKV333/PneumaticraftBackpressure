# PneumaticCraft: Backpressure

Backpressure is a port of the new [PneumaticCraft: Repressurized](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized) textures, made by Ridanisaurus, to the original 1.7.10 version of [PneumaticCraft](https://github.com/MaartenKok8/PneumaticCraft).

PneumaticCraft, originally created by [MineMaarten](https://github.com/MaartenKok8), now maintained by [desht](https://github.com/desht), is licensed under the GNU GPLv3, and so is this resource pack.
